# Build Issues - DevExpress Version Incompatibility

## Problem

The CustomXpoProviders project was designed for an older version of DevExpress XPO (likely 20.x or 21.x), but the project files reference DevExpress 25.1.5 from NuGet.

There are API incompatibilities between versions that prevent compilation:

### Errors Found:

1. **PreserveRelationshipsDataLayer.cs** - Uses APIs that don't exist in 25.1:
   - `QueryOperand` class structure has changed
   - `DBColumn` properties have changed
   - `GCRecordField` static reference doesn't work the same way

2. **PreserveRelationshipsSession.cs** - Uses reflection to access internal XPO methods:
   - `DeleteCore` method signature changed
   - `TriggerObjectDeleting/Deleted` don't exist
   - `IsGCRecordObject` method doesn't exist

3. **PreserveRelationshipsObjectSpace.cs** - XAF integration issues:
   - `CreateUnitOfWork` override signature doesn't match
   - `IXpoTypeInfoSource` interface changed
   - `IDbConnection` not found

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use Correct DevExpress Version (Recommended)

Downgrade to the DevExpress version that matches your XpoSource code:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="DevExpress.Xpo" Version="20.1.*" />
```

Or

```xml
<PackageReference Include="DevExpress.Xpo" Version="24.1.*" />
```

###  Option 2: Update Code for DevExpress 25.1

The core concept is solid, but the implementation needs to be rewritten for 25.1 APIs. This requires:

1. Understanding the new ModificationStatement/UpdateStatement API
2. Finding how to detect GCRecord updates in the new API
3. Updating reflection code for Session override
4. Fixing XAF ObjectSpace integration

### Option 3: Use Test Project Only

The test project (`CustomXpoProviders.Tests`) has simpler business objects (Customer/Order) that might compile if you:

1. Remove the main project dependency
2. Copy just the working parts you need
3. Test with in-memory database first

## Current State

- **Library Project**: Does not compile due to API incompatibilities
- **Test Project**: Cannot build because library doesn't compile
- **Documentation**: Complete and version-agnostic
- **Core Concept**: Sound - intercept UPDATE statements to preserve relationships

## Recommendation

1. Check which DevExpress version you're actually using in your main project
2. Update the package references to match
3. Test with in-memory database first (works without PostgreSQL)
4. Once compiling, run the tests to verify behavior

## Files Status

✅ **Working** (Documentation only):
- README.md
- QUICKSTART.md  
- SOLUTION_OVERVIEW.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
- DeferredDeletionAnalysis.md

❌ **Not Compiling** (Code):
- PreserveRelationshipsDataLayer.cs (API incompatibility)
- PreserveRelationshipsSession.cs (API incompatibility)
- PreserveRelationshipsObjectSpace.cs (disabled with #if FALSE)
- Examples.cs (disabled, references removed Customer/Order)

✅ **Compiles** (Test Code):
- TestBusinessObjects.cs
- TestConfiguration.cs
- GlobalUsings.cs

❌ **Cannot Build** (Depends on library):
- PreserveRelationshipsDataLayerTests.cs
- ComparisonTests.cs

## Next Steps

1. Determine your target DevExpress XPO version
2. Update package references in both .csproj files
3. Fix API calls to match that version
4. Test compilation
5. Run tests
